# tower-climb-cpp
C++ console app. Text-based adventure game using polymorphism to create unique areas for the user to navigate.

The files can be compiled into an executable named "Tower" using the 'make' command using the g++ compiler.

The player has a limited number of moves in which to complete the game and if the limit is reached a game over will occur.
The player's goal is to reach the top room of the tower. It would be unwise to ascend to the top unarmed.
